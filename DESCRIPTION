Description: Modern software engineering expects libraries or packages to come with unit tests,
             full documentation and upstream repositories so that bugs and patches can be cleanly provided.
             Practice contains a set of tools for identifying if a package follows these conventions, as well
             as extracting other metadata related to the package's content and the conventions it follows.
